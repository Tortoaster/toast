Beegone is a chess-like game themed around bees.

## Setup

The game is played on a hexagonal grid. Each player starts with a queen, a drone, and two nurses. The yellow bees get the first turn.

## Rules

In your turn, you may move any of your bees to an adjacent tile, provided that that tile is empty. If one of your pieces is adjacent to another one of your pieces, the former may ''hop over'' the latter, as long as it can stand on the tile behind it. Moving to a tile with an enemy piece will capture that piece. However, this is only allowed if your piece is at least as strong as the piece you''re trying to capture. There are 7 types of pieces in total. In increasing order of strength, there are drones, nurses, workers, builders, explorers, guards, and queens. Each piece can capture their own kind as well as pieces weaker than them, with one exception: the queen cannot capture at all (and, being the strongest piece, can therefore not be captured normally).

## End of the Game

The game is over as soon as a player manages to overpower the enemy queen, by surrounding her with 3 guards, winning the game. The game is also over if a player cannot play any valid moves, in which case they lose the game.
